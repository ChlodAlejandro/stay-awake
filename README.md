# Stay Awake!
This contains a simple `index.html` file which will require you to hover over the page within 15 minutes of the last hover or else a loud air raid siren will play. This will (hopefully) scare you shitless whenever you drift off into sleep while staying up all night working.

This repository is published as it appears on https://stay-awake.chlod.net, which includes the Random Projects footer. You can remove this by removing the `https://static.chlod.net/js/footer.js` script, CSS rules related to `#cs_footer`, and the preceeding `<script>` tag.

The click-through is required to pose as activation for the page, or else browsers will prevent audio autoplay.
